# Project Brief: Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

## Introduction

Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales pattern. 

## Key Questions and Objectives

* The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e. the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders. 
* They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
